## Nasa APOD Picture of the Day App
A new project to fetch and display data taken from Nasa's photo of the day API. Initial goal is to call the Nasa Api and render the photo of the day, on page render, allow the user to pick any individual photo by date, and implement a responsive UI with CSS styling and positioning - and use React as a client side framework - handle edge case of image being a photo or video in which case different html must be rendered dynamically. Completed Stretch goal which was to allow user to pick a random photo and display that. Next idea is to add the ability to select and add favorite photos.
